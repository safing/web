When we launched the Portmaster 2025 User Survey, we wanted to make sure the community’s input determines what we improve on next. Over 300 of you shared valuable insights and feature requests, we extend our gratitude to those participating.  We have read and evaluated every submission, and today we are sharing how your feedback is directly shaping our development roadmap.

### From Feedback to Features

Your responses highlighted a clear need for more granular control, better compatibility with other tools, and improved settings management. Here is how we plan to address that.

A strong theme was the need for quick, temporary controls for troubleshooting and specific use cases. To address this, our first priorities are:

- <span style="color:white;">**Pause feature:**</span> We will add a global switch to temporarily disable Portmaster or just the SPN, allowing you to quickly check network issues without restarting services.

- <span style="color:white;">**Network activity automatic refresh:**</span> For those who need (close to) real-time monitoring without manual action, we're adding an option to automatically refresh the Network Activity view at set intervals.

Regarding <span style="color:white;">**VPN compatibility and integration**</span>, improving how Portmaster works with VPNs was the most prominent request. Our next major project is an integration of IVPN tunnels within the Portmaster app, giving you flexible, per-app control over your IVPN connection. This foundational work building on WireGuard integration will also inform us on improving compatibility with other privacy-focused VPNs.

You also shared that managing your Portmaster rules needs to be easier. As a first step, we will improve <span style="color:white;">**configuration export**</span> with addition of batch export options.


### Looking ahead

<span style="color:white;">**Exploring Android Support**</span>

The single most requested platform for us to develop next was Android. We hear you. In parallel to the roadmap above, we are investigating what it would take to bring Portmaster to Android. We will share more details and invite your participation as we make progress.

<span style="color:white;">**Next Year**</span>

Further down the line, we will prioritise <span style="color:white;">**ARM support**</span> and <span style="color:white;">**notification improvements**</span>. The timing and scope of these additions are to be defined once we have made progress with the above. 

We're also planning improvements to <span style="color:white;">**SPN node options and reliability**</span> for next year. These enhancements require dedicated infrastructure expertise that we're currently allocating to foundational Portmaster work. Once we have those resources available, we'll be able to give SPN the focused attention it deserves without compromising the app improvements we have identified based on your feedback. 

 

Thank you for being an essential part of this process. This roadmap is a direct result of your participation, and we are committed to building the future of Portmaster with you.
