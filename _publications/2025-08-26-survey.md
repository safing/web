We are launching our 2025 User Survey to get feedback from the Postmaster community. Following the recent release of Portmaster v2 and Safing joining forces with IVPN, we are at a significant milestone. 

This survey is our opportunity to better understand your Portmaster experience, what you value, and where we can improve. Your feedback will help guide our roadmap and ensure we build the features and improvements that matter most to you.

### What is the survey about?
We want your thoughts on usability, compatibility with other tools and services, and future feature development.

### Who should participate? 
The survey is for every user of Postmaster. Whether you use the free version or are a Plus or Pro subscriber, we welcome your feedback.

### How long it takes to complete?
It takes just 5-15 minutes to complete, depending on the level of detail you provide.

The survey is be open until 15 Sept 2025. 

 

### Our commitment to privacy

We built this survey with your privacy as a priority. It runs on open source software hosted on our own infrastructure. Your submission is anonymous, we do not link survey responses to your Safing account during storage or analysis. Most questions are optional, allowing you to share only the information you are comfortable with.


Ready to share your thoughts? To access the survey now, please log in to your [Safing Account](https://account.safing.io/account).

 

### What happens next

After the survey closes, we will analyze responses. We plan to share a summary of the aggregated results with the community in a future blog post, so you can see how your input is shaping the direction of Portmaster.

Thank you for your continued support and for helping us make Portmaster better.
