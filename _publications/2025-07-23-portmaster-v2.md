We’re excited to announce the official release of Portmaster v2! The latest stable version, 2.0.23, is now available and v2 is our recommended default for all Portmaster users.

## A New Chapter for Portmaster

As you may have seen in our [recent announcement](https://safing.io/blog/2024/12/03/a-new-chapter-begins/), Safing has joined forces with IVPN. This marks a significant step forward for Portmaster and its community. The transition brings together a shared vision for privacy and security, and more resources to ensure Portmaster’s continued growth. The groundwork for v2 was laid by the original Safing team, with the IVPN team now focused on ongoing maintenance, bug fixes, and new developments.

## Why v2 Matters

Portmaster v2 doesn’t introduce flashy new features, but it brings major foundational improvements that pave the way for future innovation and stability. These core changes require a fresh install, as they couldn’t be delivered via auto-update.

**Key improvements:**

- **Offline Installers**  
  Set up Portmaster without needing an internet connection — perfect for secure or air-gapped environments.
- **Streamlined Updates**  
  Updates now download and install faster and use less storage, making the whole process more efficient.
- **Better Linux Support**  
  Improved compatibility with immutable Linux distributions such as Fedora Silverblue and NixOS.
- **Smarter DNS Monitoring**  
  Enhanced VPN compatibility and privacy, with more robust DNS monitoring.
- **Modern Database Engine**  
  A switch to an SQLite backend increases stability and keeps the database lean.

> “Working with IVPN on Portmaster v2 was a fantastic experience! We collaborated closely on finalizing the release, and the IVPN team did a great job testing and squashing bugs in the final stages. Portmaster v2 is a high-quality, well-tested product thanks to IVPN’s dedication.”  
> — Daniel, Co-Founder of Safing

## Installation & Migration

Upgrading to Portmaster v2 is simple. The installer will automatically migrate your existing v1 configuration and remove Portmaster v1, ensuring a smooth transition. 

If you need to revert for any reason, you can easily roll back: just uninstall Portmaster v2 and reinstall v1 - your settings will be preserved. *Note: Leave 'Delete application data' checked on Windows during the uninstall process.*

## What’s Next?

- **Deeper IVPN Integration**  
  We’re working on integrating IVPN functionality directly within Portmaster, similar to the current SPN integration, to provide even more privacy options.
- **Community Survey in August**  
  We want to hear from you! Watch out for our upcoming survey — your feedback and suggestions will help shape the future of Portmaster.
- **Continued v1 Support**  
  Portmaster v1 will remain available and supported for at least six more months, giving you plenty of time to upgrade when it suits you.
